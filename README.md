**Profile App** is an app that let's users share their contact information, educational background and job aspirations and then matches them with other users with similar job aspirations, who attended same school or even share names with and helping them bond 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Robinhood
Feature 1: User-friendly Stock Trading Interface
Feature 2: Real-time Stock Market Updates

Slack
Feature 1: Team Communication and Collaboration
Feature 2: Integration with Third-party Tools and Apps

WhatsApp
Feature 1: Secure End-to-End Encryption
Feature 2: Instant Messaging and Multimedia Sharing

I have an idea for a social finance app called "FinSocial." It combines elements of Robinhood and social networking platforms. Users can create investment groups with friends or like-minded individuals to collectively invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies. Key features include:

Group Investing: Users can form investment groups, pool funds, and make collective investment decisions.
Real-time Updates: The app provides real-time stock and cryptocurrency market updates, similar to Robinhood.
Social Interaction: Users can communicate, share insights, and collaborate within their investment groups, fostering a sense of community.
Secure Transactions: Just like WhatsApp, the app ensures end-to-end encryption to protect users' financial data.
This app aims to make finance more accessible and enjoyable by merging investment opportunities with social interaction and knowledge-sharing.


## Notes

I think the major challenge for me was familiarizing myself with the Xcode interface. Looking back now, I realized that I jumped into trying to solve the pre-work without the fundamentals and explains why I spent so much time. I plan to improve on this in the future
